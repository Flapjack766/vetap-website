  "BLOG_POST1_INTRO": "Next.js 15 represents a major leap forward in web development, introducing groundbreaking features that transform how we build modern applications. Released in October 2024, this version focuses on performance, developer experience, and production readiness. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore every major feature with practical code examples, real-world use cases, and actionable insights.",
  "BLOG_POST1_WHAT_IS": "## What is Next.js 15?\n\nNext.js 15 is the latest major version of the popular React framework, built by Vercel. It introduces revolutionary features like React Server Components, Partial Prerendering, and enhanced caching strategies that make web applications faster, more efficient, and easier to build.\n\n### Key Questions Answered:\n\n**What's new in Next.js 15?**\n- React Server Components (RSC) for reduced bundle sizes\n- Partial Prerendering (PPR) for instant page loads\n- Enhanced App Router with better performance\n- Advanced caching with `unstable_cache` API\n- Improved TypeScript support\n- Turbopack bundler (700x faster than Webpack)\n\n**Next.js 14 vs Next.js 15: What Changed?**\n\n| Feature | Next.js 14 | Next.js 15 |\n|---------|------------|------------|\n| Server Components | Experimental | Stable & Production-Ready |\n| Bundler | Webpack | Turbopack (700x faster) |\n| Caching | Basic | Advanced with `unstable_cache` |\n| TypeScript | Good | Excellent (better inference) |\n| PPR | Not Available | Fully Supported |\n| Performance | Fast | 40% Faster |\n| Bundle Size | Standard | 30% Smaller |",
  "BLOG_POST1_RSC": "## React Server Components: The Game Changer\n\nReact Server Components (RSC) are the cornerstone of Next.js 15. Unlike traditional React components that run in the browser, Server Components execute on the server, dramatically reducing JavaScript bundle size.\n\n### Why Server Components Matter\n\n- **40% faster page loads** on average\n- **30% smaller bundle sizes**\n- **Direct database access** without API routes\n- **Better security** - sensitive logic stays on server\n- **Improved SEO** - content rendered on server\n\n### Code Example: Basic Server Component\n\n```tsx\n// app/products/page.tsx\n// This is a Server Component (default in Next.js 15)\nimport { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';\n\nasync function ProductsPage() {\n  // Direct database access - no API route needed!\n  const supabase = await createClient();\n  const { data: products } = await supabase\n    .from('products')\n    .select('*')\n    .limit(10);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Products</h1>\n      {products?.map(product => (\n        <div key={product.id}>\n          <h2>{product.name}</h2>\n          <p>${product.price}</p>\n        </div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ProductsPage;\n```\n\n### When to Use Server vs Client Components\n\n**Use Server Components for:**\n- Data fetching\n- Accessing backend resources\n- Large dependencies\n- Sensitive information\n\n**Use Client Components (`'use client'`) for:**\n- Interactivity (onClick, onChange)\n- Browser APIs (localStorage, window)\n- State and effects (useState, useEffect)\n- Third-party libraries that need browser APIs",
  "BLOG_POST1_PPR": "## Partial Prerendering (PPR): Best of Both Worlds\n\nPartial Prerendering combines the speed of static generation with the flexibility of dynamic content. Pages are pre-rendered at build time, but dynamic sections are streamed in real-time.\n\n### Real-World Impact\n\n- **60% improvement** in Time to First Byte (TTFB)\n- **Instant page loads** with static content\n- **Progressive enhancement** for dynamic data\n- **Better user experience** - no loading spinners\n\n### Code Example: Implementing PPR\n\n```tsx\n// app/dashboard/page.tsx\nexport const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';\n\nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  // Static content renders instantly\n  const staticContent = (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to Dashboard</h1>\n      <nav>...</nav>\n    </div>\n  );\n\n  // Dynamic content streams in\n  const userData = await fetchUserData();\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {staticContent}\n      <UserProfile data={userData} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Before vs After PPR\n\n**Before (Traditional SSR):**\n- Wait for all data → Render → Send HTML\n- TTFB: 800ms\n- User sees blank screen\n\n**After (PPR):**\n- Send static shell immediately → Stream dynamic data\n- TTFB: 200ms\n- User sees content instantly",
  "BLOG_POST1_CACHING": "## Advanced Caching Strategies\n\nNext.js 15 introduces smarter caching mechanisms with the new `unstable_cache` API, giving you fine-grained control over data caching.\n\n### Code Example: Using unstable_cache\n\n```tsx\n// lib/data.ts\nimport { unstable_cache } from 'next/cache';\n\n// Cache database query for 1 hour\nconst getCachedProducts = unstable_cache(\n  async () => {\n    const supabase = await createClient();\n    const { data } = await supabase.from('products').select('*');\n    return data;\n  },\n  ['products'], // Cache key\n  {\n    revalidate: 3600, // 1 hour\n    tags: ['products'], // For on-demand revalidation\n  }\n);\n\n// Usage in Server Component\nexport default async function ProductsPage() {\n  const products = await getCachedProducts();\n  return <ProductList products={products} />;\n}\n```\n\n### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) Example\n\n```tsx\n// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\nexport const revalidate = 3600; // Revalidate every hour\n\nexport default async function BlogPost({ params }) {\n  const post = await fetchPost(params.slug);\n  return <Article post={post} />;\n}\n\n// On-demand revalidation\n// Call this API route when content changes\n// POST /api/revalidate?tag=blog&secret=YOUR_SECRET\n```",
  "BLOG_POST1_USE_CASES": "## Real-World Use Cases\n\n### 1.
